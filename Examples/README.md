About these examples
====================
These examples should be considered a starting point and not fully implemented.

A calculator were the rules are build using the "recursive descent parser" rules.
It supports basic arithmetic and you can invoke function like in the JavaScript Math class.

INI Reader
----------
A variant of an INI reader which parses the text into a JSON object.

JSON Reader
-----------
An almost fully implemented working JSON reader which parses the text into a JSON object. 
The part that isn't working is support for all the different variable names that for example has weird Unicode characters in it.
